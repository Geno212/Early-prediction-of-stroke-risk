# Early Prediction of Stroke Risk

This project analyzes healthcare data to predict stroke risk using various machine learning models.

## Project Structure
- `stroke_prediction_milestones.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project

## Dataset
our project uses the `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` file.

## Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Analysis
You can either run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook stroke_prediction_milestones.ipynb
```


## Models Implemented
phase 1:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
later in phase 2:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Clustering (K-Means and Hierarchical)
